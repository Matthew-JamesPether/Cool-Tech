# Cool-Tech

I developed a website that uses Express to design a backend server that handles data from Atlas Mongoose. The server then responds with specific authentic data when called from the frontend using a token. For the front end of my app, I used React to design an interface that lets cool-tech manage their users' credentials from multiple different sites. The website also allows normal users to add more credentials. Users with the role of management have more authorization and can also update credentials. Admin users are given the most authorization because they can change a user's role as well as change the organizational unit and division a user is in.
